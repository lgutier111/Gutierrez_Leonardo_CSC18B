OBJECT:
To repeat correctly a longer and longer sequence of signals.
FOR ONE PLAYER:
1. Slide red ON/OFF switch to "ON".
2. Slide blue GAME SELECTOR switch to "I".
3. Slide blue SKILL LEVEL switch to 1, 2, 3 or 4.
4. Press red START button; SIMON will give the first signal.
5. Repeat the signal by pressing the same lens.
6. SIMON will duplicate the first signal and will add one.
7. Repeat these two signals by pressing the same lenses.
8. SIMON will duplicate these first two signals and add one.
9. Continue in this manner as long as you can repeat each sequence
of signals correctly.
10. Notice that after the 5th, 9th and 13th signals in a sequence, SIMON automatically increases the tempo.
11. If you fail to repeat a sequence exactly or if you take more than 5 seconds to repeat a signal, SIMON responds with a
"RAZZ" sound; you have lost, and this sequence of signals is over.
TO WIN:
Repeat the number of sequences for skill levels 1, 2, or 3 and SIMON will salute you with six short signals from the last lens you
played. For the tough skill level 4, repeat the 31 signal sequence and SIMON blows its mind, loses its memory and gives itself the
RAZZ sound.
Congratulations, you have beaten SIMON!
